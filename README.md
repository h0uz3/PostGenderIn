@rashfael forced me (by forcibly using force) to integrate Bootstrap. I did not yet look into it a lot.
Basically, this is a huge pile of crap and the first, very, very, very basic iteration already did it's job. But had to do something with it, as simply taking input from a POST request and putting three different strings into an SVG just ain't enough. But still, it's basically not doing more than that.
In the future, there might be a better style of formatting the text in case there are more than n lines. Probably there will be a disambiguation between having a clear one-liner (like a poster with just "Infodesk") and things like "we don't lend cables and shit, fuck off!".
